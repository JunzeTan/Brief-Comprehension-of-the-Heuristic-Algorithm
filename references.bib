abstract = {Given an undirected distance graph G=(V, E, d) and a set S, where V is the set of vertices in G, E is the set of edges in G, d is a distance function which maps E into the set of nonnegative numbers and S⊑V is a subset of the vertices of V, the Steiner tree problem is to find a tree of G that spans S with minimal total distance on its edges. In this paper, we analyze a heuristic algorithm for the Steiner tree problem. The heuristic algorithm has a worst case time complexity of O(¦S¦¦V¦ 2) on a random access computer and it guarantees to output a tree that spans S with total distance on its edges no more than 2(1−1/l) times that of the optimal tree, where l is the number of leaves in the optimal tree.},

abstract = {Abstract An algorithm for solving the Steiner problem on a finite undirected graph is presented. This algorithm computes the set of graph arcs of minimum total length needed to connect a specified set of k graph nodes. If the entire graph contains n nodes, the algorithm requires time proportional to n3/2 + n2 (2k-1 - k - 1) + n(3k-1 - 2k + 3)/2. The time requirement above includes the term n3/2, which can be eliminated if the set of shortest paths connecting each pair of nodes in the graph is available.},

abstract = {We present a new implementation of the Kou, Markowsky and Berman algorithm for finding a Steiner tree for a connected, undirected distance graph with a specified subset S of the set of vertices V. The total distance of all edges of this Steiner tree is at most 2(1-1/l) times that of a Steiner minimal tree, where l is the minimum number of leaves in any Steiner minimal tree for the given graph. The algorithm runs in O(|E|+|V|log|V|) time in the worst case, where E is the set of all edges and V the set of all vertices in the graph.}
